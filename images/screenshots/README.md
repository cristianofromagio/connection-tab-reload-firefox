## Tools

- Recorded with [ScreenToGif](https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif)
- Mouse macro recorded with [Macro Recorder](https://www.macrorecorder.com/)

## Steps to reproduce

For latest screenshot (v2.0):

- Open Firefox window with only the extension enabled on the toolbar
- Resize window to 830x650
- Open `MacroRecorder-v2.0.mrf` into Macro Recorder
- Align resized window extension icon + menu + tabs with mouse macro recorded positions
  + Macro was created on 1600x900 resolution and the window was aligned to the right so floating tooltips from extension icon on the toolbar would appear all inside the window boundaries
- Resized window (830x650) relative position for 1600x900 resolution:
